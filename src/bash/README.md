These are functions that are meant to be called by `src/main.sh`. Functions are designed to generally setup and submit pyspark functions found in `src/python/` via ssh. All bash functions source `config/bash/env.sh` for AWS, postgres setup. In addition, each bash function passes sensitive AWS and postgres keys over ssh ensuring there is no permanent key storage on cloud instances.
